NY Citibike Infographic Visualizations Exercise with Tableau Public

In Tableau, I decided to analyze the total rides by gender, day, and age – which accounted for 3 of my individual visualizations and combined to create a “Rider Summary Statistics” dashboard. 

•	Shows Citibike Riders by Age...shows most peak of riders are at age 38, with a steep decline after age 57, and a drastic increase after 30. 
•	Shows Citibike Riders by Gender... shows the vast majority of riders are either male, or unknown  
•	Shows Popularity of Days of the Week to Ride...As one would guess, the weekends are the most popular times to ride with Mondays and Tuesdays being the least popular days to ride, progressively

I also explored which stations were the most popular stations by map and bar chart – which accounted for the last 2 of my individual visualizations which I used in by “Count of Bike ID by Stations” dashboard. 

•	Top 10 CitiStations..#1 was W 20 street and 11th Ave station, #2,#3, #4 and #5 were all different Broadway street stations. Further details were shown on the bubble map for all the remainder of stations
